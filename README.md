# docker-compose-recreator-swarm-mode
need to recreate a docker compose stack because you deleted the original file or you had problems with portainer? no problem i got you. Note need to be run in the master node and it will create a .yaml in the same folder of the script. The yaml file will be as close as the original one, may need to edit the docker compose file. Use it with caution!
